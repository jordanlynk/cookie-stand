                    Pat's Salmon Cookies was originally founded by his father in 1937, of which he named after his beloved son. In the beginning of his operation, he opened his first location in Seattle's own Pike Place Market. Seeing as the business boomed more than he could have ever imagined, Pat stepped in to help run operations and eventually took over the family business. From there Pat opened up another 4 locations, worldwide! Pat lives in Seattle with his wife Carol, his son Trevor and his daughter Chinook. They all maintain a presecence and energy within the family business. When they aren't busy making those delicious salmon cookies, they love to explore the great pacific northwest. Pat was gifted a special salmon shaped cookie cutter that has been passed down from generation to generation, that's their secret to a perfectly shaped salmon cookie. Pat and his family hope to share their love and enthusiam for these one of a kind cookies, head on down to one of their many locations and pick yourself up one or maybe twenty!
